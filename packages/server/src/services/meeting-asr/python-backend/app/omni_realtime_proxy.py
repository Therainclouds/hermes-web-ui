"""
DashScope Omni-Realtime proxy, driven by the official Qwen Omni SDK.

Bridges a frontend WebSocket and the Aliyun DashScope real-time multimodal
endpoint that powers the Qwen-Omni-Realtime model family. The default target
is ``qwen3.8-omni-flash-realtime`` (DashScope model id) which the SDK ships
in ``dashscope.audio.qwen_omni.OmniRealtimeConversation``; earlier generations
(``qwen3.5-omni-flash-realtime`` / ``qwen3.5-omni-plus-realtime``) were driven
by hand-rolled WebSocket frames and are no longer supported here.

  * ``qwen3.8-omni-flash-realtime`` (default, fastest)
  * Older Qwen-Omni-Realtime families — set ``OMNI_REALTIME_MODEL`` to the
    model id you want; the proxy drives whatever the SDK accepts, but only
    qwen3.8 has been validated against the operator presets shipped here.

The wire protocol the SDK speaks is OpenAI-Realtime-API compatible; the
upstream URL is ``wss://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/api-ws/v1/realtime?model=<name>``
(or the region-specific ``{WorkspaceId}.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com``
variant). Authentication uses the same DASHSCOPE_API_KEY as the rest of the
meeting ASR service — we deliberately *do not* expose a per-session key from
the client.

Thread / asyncio bridging
------------------------

The SDK is built on top of the synchronous ``websocket-client`` library:
``OmniRealtimeConversation`` runs its ``WebSocketApp`` on a daemon thread
and delivers each event through ``OmniRealtimeCallback.on_event(message)``.
FastAPI, by contrast, drives this proxy from an asyncio event loop.

We bridge the two via an :class:`asyncio.Queue`:

  * The SDK callback runs on the WebSocket thread; it forwards every parsed
    event into the queue with ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe``.
  * :meth:`OmniRealtimeProxy.upstream_events` is the asyncio consumer: it
    pulls items off the queue, observes response / buffer lifecycle state,
    and yields the original JSON strings to the FastAPI ``pump_upstream``
    task (which then runs ``translate_event``).

A sentinel (``_STOP_SENTINEL``) pushed by ``on_close`` or by our own
:meth:`OmniRealtimeProxy.close` makes the upstream iterator return.

Frontend protocol (binary in, JSON events out — unchanged from the previous
hand-rolled proxy):

  Frame 1 (text, required): control JSON
      {"type": "start", "voice": "Ethan", "instructions": "...", "model": "...",
       "tools": [{"type": "function", "name": "...", "description": "...",
                  "parameters": {...}}, ...]}
    `model` / `voice` / `instructions` / `tools` are optional; the server-side
    config.py defaults apply otherwise. The SDK's ``update_session`` is called
    immediately after the upstream handshake with these values so the user
    can switch persona / voice per session without restarting the backend.
    When `tools` is provided the session is configured with
    ``tool_choice: "auto"`` and the model may emit function calls that are
    relayed to the client.

  Subsequent frames (binary): raw PCM16 mono little-endian Int16 samples,
    exactly what the upstream API expects in ``input_audio_buffer.append``
    payloads (we re-encode to base64 here before forwarding via
    ``OmniRealtimeConversation.append_audio``). The bridge resamples browser
    mic input to 16 kHz on input and the upstream emits 24 kHz on output by
    default, matching the SDK's ``AudioFormat.PCM_16000HZ_MONO_16BIT`` /
    ``AudioFormat.PCM_24000HZ_MONO_16BIT`` enum values.

  Text frames (JSON): control frames the frontend can send at any time:
      {"type": "cancel"} — abort the current in-flight response
      {"type": "ping"}   — heartbeat (echoed back as {"type": "pong"})
      {"type": "tool_result", "call_id": "...", "output": "..."}
                           — client-side function-call result; forwarded
                             upstream as ``conversation.item.create``
                             (function_call_output) followed by
                             ``response.create`` so the model continues.
      {"type": "image", "image": "<base64 JPEG>"}
                           — one camera frame (data URL or raw base64);
                             forwarded upstream as ``input_image_buffer.append``.
                             DashScope constraints: JPG/JPEG only, ≤256 KB
                             base64, ~1 fps recommended, and audio must be
                             appended before image data — enforced locally
                             (see ``_audio_seen`` / ``_audio_appended_since_commit``
                             below).
      {"type": "text", "text": "<prompt>"}
                           — inject a text-only user message (conversation
                             item) and ask the model to reply *within the same
                             session* (reuses the multimodal context it already
                             saw/heard). Used by 口语对练's same-session closing
                             review.
      {"type": "stop"}   — flush audio buffer and close the session
                             (we send ``session.finish`` upstream before
                             tearing the WS down).

Server → frontend frames (also unchanged):

  Binary frames: raw PCM16 mono (delta chunks from upstream
    ``response.audio.delta`` events, concatenated and forwarded as soon as
    they arrive).

  Text frames (JSON): ``ready`` / ``listening`` / ``speech_stopped`` /
    ``user_transcript`` / ``transcript_delta`` / ``transcript`` /
    ``response_started`` / ``response_done`` / ``error`` / ``stopped`` /
    ``pong``. The translator in :func:`translate_event` does the protocol
    mapping.

        """Append one JPEG camera frame to the upstream input_image_buffer.

        DashScope's Omni-Realtime API accepts frames via
        ``input_image_buffer.append`` with the image as raw base64 (no data
        URL prefix). The browser ``canvas.toDataURL`` payload arrives with a
        ``data:image/jpeg;base64,`` prefix, so we strip it before forwarding.

        Upstream constraints (see official docs): JPG/JPEG only, single image
        ≤ 256 KB base64, ~1 fps recommended, and audio must have been
        appended first. The check is per commit cycle, not just per session:
        DashScope commits (and thereby clears) the audio + image buffers on
        every ``input_audio_buffer.commit`` (in VAD mode the server
        auto-commits at the end of each utterance), so a frame arriving
        after a commit but before the next audio append would be rejected
        with "append image before append audio". ``_audio_seen`` guards the
        session start; ``_audio_appended_since_commit`` guards every
        post-commit window.
