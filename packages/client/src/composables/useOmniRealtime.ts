/**
 * Omni-Realtime client composable.
 *
 * Wraps the `/ws/omni-realtime` WebSocket exposed by the meeting backend
 * (which itself proxies DashScope's `qwen3.5-omni-flash-realtime` model)
 * and handles:
 *
 *   - Audio capture: microphone → Float32 → resample to 24 kHz → Int16 PCM →
 *     binary WebSocket frames.
 *   - Audio playback: binary WebSocket frames (raw PCM16 @ 24 kHz) → scheduled
 *     into a Web Audio buffer that plays through the default output device.
 *   - Conversation transcript rendering via server-emitted JSON events.
 *
 * The DashScope audio format on the wire is fixed at 24 kHz / 16-bit / mono —
 * matching `omni_realtime_proxy.SAMPLE_RATE`. We resample on both ends so
 * that the user-facing AudioContext can run at whatever rate the browser
 * picked (typically 44.1 / 48 kHz).
